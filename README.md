COMPX241 Smoke and Mirrors Project - A hot air balloon simulator using real world weather and mapping data


## Installation/Setup

If your command-line environment does not already have NodeJS installed:

```
  cd nodejs-for-bitw/
  ./GET-NODEJ.sh
  cd ..
```

Then, each time you want to run _node_ and _npm_, run:
```
   source ./nodejs-for-bitw/ACTIVATE-NODEJS.bash
```

First time setup, you might also want to make sure your _npm_ is the most
up to date:
```
  npm update npm
```
