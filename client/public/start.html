	  <p>
	    Welcome to <i>Around the World: Just Blowin’ in the Wind</i>,
	    a 3D simulated, city-guessing game that lets you fly over famous cities
	    and attractions around the world. Embark on a virtual adventure in the
	    comfort of your hot air balloon, while competing with other players
	    to guess the city correctly and win the game!
	  </p>

	  <p>	   
	    How to play:
	  </p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>
	      <b>Join a Game Room:</b>
	      Start a game with your friends and compete against each other.
	    </li>
	      
	    <li>
	      <b>Spawn in the City:</b>
	      Each player’s hot air balloon will spawn at a random location over the city.
	    </li>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<b>Starting the Journey:</b>
		When one of the players presses the map navigator start button, all players’ hot air balloons
		will begin to move automatically according to the direction and speed of the wind, based on
		realtime weather data.
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<b>Text Chat Hints:</b>
		As you fly over the location, hints will appear over time in the text-chat.  First
		hints about the country the location is in, then hints about the location itself.
		The final hint is an anagram of the location.
	      </li>

	      <li>
		<b>Stopping the Journey:</b>
		If a player presses the pause button, then that player&mdash;and only that player&mdash;returns
		to the position where they started flying over the location.  This is alternative way you
		can try and guess the location.  Hints are no longer display, however the player now
		has complete freedom to move over the city through mouse and keyboard input.
	      </li>
	      
	      <li>
		<b>Adjust Speed:</b>
		If a player increases the movement speed of the balloon,
		all players’ hot air balloons will speed up (vice versa).
	      </li>

	    </ul>
	    
	    <li>
	      <b>Make your Guess:</b>
	      Use the chat to type in your guess for the city your balloon is flying over.
	    </li>

	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<b>Starting the Timer:</b>
		Once one player guesses the city correctly, a 30 second timer is started for all remaining players in the room to guess.
	      </li>

	      <li>
		<b>Scoring System:</b>
		The first correct guess earns 2 points, while other players earn 1 point for correct guesses.
	      </li>
	    </ul>
	    
	    <li>
	      <b>Explore New Cities:</b>
	      When all players have successfully guessed correctly, or the timer has run out, all the players are
	      moved on to a new a new location.
	    </li>

	    <li>
	      <b>How to win?</b> The first player to reach 5 points wins the game!
	    </li>
	  </ol>
